An old Space Invaders a-like which I made for a University course.

To run:
If you are running Windows, just go into the \src folder and run A.bat
Otherwise, be sure to compile and run the game from the src folder rather than the src\Alpha Battalion folder, as the source is contained in a package.

Instructions:
Arrow keys to move
Space to shoot missile
B to shoot bomb, B again to explode bomb

Shoot boxes to pick options

Shoot all aliens in the level and try not to die!
